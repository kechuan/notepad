# Welcome to LeafNote

## Say hello!

Hi there! Welcome to LeafNote!

LeafNote is a powerful note-taking application. It's designed based on Material Design, provides rich and beautiful themes. It's fluent and exquisite, supports markdown and many useful features, such as **reciprocal link**, **note structure**, **file tree viewer** etc. It's developed for **cross-platform** collaboration.

Compared with other Apps, LeafNote:

‚ú® First, It's **multi-level directory**, based on the file system. At the same time, it provides **tag and category** to manage your notes. It reference notes and images by **relative path**. Therefore, LeafNote can synchronize notes with other platforms with no change.

‚ú® LeafNote can insert **pictures** taken in or from album into notes. Pictures are stored on your phone, which is reassuring and safe. Pictures inserted in notes can be previewed directly on other platforms.

‚ú® For **synchronization**, LeafNote provides "Export/Import" and WebDAV, and more in the future. By synchronization, you can modify and browse notes on other platforms to achieve cross-platform collaboration.

**Life is expression**! As you can see, LeafNote adopts a simple and elegant design. We hope to combine beauty, culture and software design. It isn't just an editing tool. In the future, we will develop more interesting features.

**Stay tuned~**

## Markdown sample

Now, let me show you the markdown that LeafNote support.

In LeafNote, you can use various Markdown syntax, such as **bold**, *italic*, [link](https://meiyan.tech/note_home), ~~strike through~~, `symbol`.

And advanced, for example,

### 1. Table

The table with alignment.

| Align left | Align center  | Align Right |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

### 2. Math expression

Inline math expression such as $C_n^2$, $\vec a$, $\overrightarrow{xy}$, $\mathbb{A}$, $10^10+10^{10}$, $\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$.

And more complicated ones, for example, $\sum_{i=0}^N\int_{a}^{b}g(t,i)\text{d}t$, $\int_0^\infty{fxdx}$ and $\sqrt[x]{y}$.

Also, the single line math expressions, such as

$$\begin{matrix}
1&0&0\\
0&1&0\\
0&0&1\\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\sin xÔºå\ln xÔºå\max(A,B,C)$$

$$\begin{bmatrix}
{a_{11}}&{a_{12}}&{\cdots}&{a_{1n}}\\
{a_{21}}&{a_{22}}&{\cdots}&{a_{2n}}\\
{\vdots}&{\vdots}&{\ddots}&{\vdots}\\
{a_{m1}}&{a_{m2}}&{\cdots}&{a_{mn}}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\begin{array}{c|lll}
{‚Üì}&{a}&{b}&{c}\\
\hline
{R_1}&{c}&{b}&{a}\\
{R_2}&{b}&{c}&{c}\\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{cases}
a_1x+b_1y+c_1z=d_1\\
a_2x+b_2y+c_2z=d_2\\
a_3x+b_3y+c_3z=d_3\\
\end{cases}
$$

### 3. List

* the list item 1 by `*`
- the list item 2 by `-`
* the list item 3 by `*`

### 4. HTML & image

LeafNote allows you to insert pictures into notes by relative path. Whether you migrate your notes to other platforms or import notes from other platforms, LeafNote can parse and display according to the relative path of the picture.

<div>
<img src="https://meiyan.tech/rest/file/get/leaf_bg.jpg">
</div>

This is a image inserted by HTML, also, you can use the traditional image symbol of markdown, `![]()`, to insert image.

### 5. Todo list

You can add the todo item by `- []` or `- [x]`:

- [ ] The todo item
- [x] The finished todo item

### 6. Quote

> This is the quote content for LeafNote sample.
> Append two blanks, then it will break to the second line.

### 7. Code with highlight

Here is a code of Java. LeafNote also support many other language highlight.
In addition, you can choose your ideal style from many different code styles.

```Java
// This is the Java code sample with highlight.
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 0;
    int b = 0;
    int c = cal(a, b);
    System.out.println(c);
}
```

### 8. Text

This line is used to show a normal text.

    Use 1 tab or 4 spaces in front of a line can get a code block.
    You can also use the tab or spaces in another line, which will also be included in the same code block.

```
Another way to get a code block is to put your text between three ` symbols
```

To use an inline code, you need only put your text between two symbols, like `linux` `Network` `Socket` `epoll`, etc.

### 9. üéâReciprocal link & note structure

Now, slide the left side of your phone to open the left drawer of the viewer page. The reciprocal link and note structure will be displayed. The note structure is interactive, click the title, then the page will scroll to it.

How to use reciprocal link? That's easy in LeafNote. Get into the editor page, click the link button on the bottom, choose note link, and then you are able to choose note from the note tree.
